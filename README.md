<h2 align="center">üíª My Story</h2>

For years, the service grind was my daily reality - restaurants, retail, you name it. That experience built some solid skills when it came to dealing with customers and multitasking like a boss. A part of me wanted a different kind of challenge, one that would push the boundaries of my intellectual curiosity.

Well, an unexpected layoff ended up being just the kick in the pants I needed. Instead of moping, I used it to finally pursue my passion for tech.

With a fire lit, I didn't waste time signing up for an intense coding bootcamp. Full immersion into JavaScript and Python - every line of code was like solving an addictive puzzle.

Now I've got my eyes on the tech scene, armed with customer service experience and a constant drive to level up my coding abilities. The opportunities in this ever-evolving world are exciting. I'm ready to dive in headfirst on this cutting-edge frontier.
